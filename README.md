Open Headunit is an Android app that allows you to turn your Android tablet or phone into an Android Auto receiver. This project is a revived version of the original headunit project by the great Michael Reid. The original project can be found here:
https://github.com/mikereidis/headunit

## NOTE!
**Android Auto 17.4 and newer breaks almost all third-party wireless triggers including Self-Mode and the automated launch via Wireless Helper.**
Google has introduced internal changes preventing projection from launching automatically without the native developer server or hardware dongles. To connect wirelessly or run in Self-Mode on AA 17.4+, please use one of the 4 options below:
1. **USB Wireless Android Auto Dongle (Recommended):** Hardware dongles provide seamless, hardware-level plug-and-play.
2. **Native Mode:** Direct Wi-Fi Direct or Headunit Hotspot handshake.
3. **Headunit Server (Developer Mode):** The **only remaining solution for Self-Mode!** On your phone, open Android Auto developer settings and tap "Start Headunit Server".
4. **Wireless Helper:** Continues to work reliably for Android Auto versions up to **17.3**.

## How to use
**Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/andreknieriem/open-headunit/wiki) for detailed documentation, setup guides and troubleshooting!**

### Wired USB Connection
- Connect your Android device (phone) to the tablet running Open Headunit via USB cable.
- Make sure that Android Auto is installed on your phone.
- Set your phone to Host-Mode if nescessary and select Android Auto
- Click the USB Button in Open Headunit, find your phone and click the right button to allow connection
- Click on your phone in the list and wait for Android Auto to start

### Wireless Connection Options
Choose from one of four connection strategies depending on your Android Auto version and setup:

#### 1. USB Wireless Android Auto Dongle (Most Reliable)
- A standard hardware USB Wireless Android Auto Dongle (plugged into the headunit) handles the entire wireless negotiation independently.
- Provides seamless plug-and-play connection regardless of phone Android Auto version.

#### 2. Native Mode (Wi-Fi Direct / Headunit Hotspot)
- Directly communicates with Android Auto's native wireless protocol without helper apps.
- Supports **Wi-Fi Direct (P2P)** or the **Headunit Hotspot** transport.
- Configure under Open Headunit Settings -> **Android Auto Mode** -> **Native Mode**.

#### FYT external Bluetooth module transport (experimental)
On FYT units where the phone pairs for calls with a separate Bluetooth module (for example **DUDUAUTO** on DUDUOS), Native Mode can carry its Android Auto Bluetooth handshake through `/dev/auto_serial`, the relay the stock Car Link app (`com.syu.carlink`) uses, while calls remain on the module and the vehicle microphone/speakers. Tested so far only on DUDUOS with a BLINK module.

Requirements:
- An FYT unit that exposes `/dev/auto_serial` (Car Link's external-module backend, `sys.fyt.bluetooth_type` above zero).
- Nothing extra where the node is app-openable, as it is for the stock Car Link. Where it is not (node mode or SELinux), root access for Open Headunit, used as a fallback.
- The stock `com.syu.carlink` package disabled, because two readers on the same terminal split protocol messages.
- The phone paired with the module; pairing and phone priority remain managed by the module.

Setup:
1. Disable the stock client: `adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.syu.carlink` (prefix with `su -c` if the shell refuses).
2. In Open Headunit, select **Native Mode** and enable **Connect through the FYT external Bluetooth module**.
3. Keep the phone paired with the module and connect normally.

On a detected FYT module unit with this transport off, Native Mode refuses to start and names this setting, instead of listening on a radio the phone is not paired with. If the channel cannot be opened (Car Link still enabled or running, or the node not app-openable and root denied), the reason is shown on screen and retried with a growing delay.

Android Bluetooth driver selection, preferred-phone and wake-list controls are intentionally hidden on this route because Android cannot see or dial phones bonded to the external module. To roll back, turn this transport off and re-enable the stock client with `adb shell pm enable com.syu.carlink` (prefix with `su -c` if needed).

#### 3. Headunit Server (Essential for Self-Mode on AA 17.4+)
- Starts the native Android Auto developer server directly on your phone or on the same device (Self-Mode).
- **Setup:**
  1. Open Android Auto settings on your phone (or tablet in Self-Mode).
  2. Scroll down and tap **Version** 10 times to unlock Developer settings.
  3. Tap the three-dot menu in the top right corner and choose **Start headunit server**.
  4. In Open Headunit, tap the **WiFi** button to connect (or use Self-Mode).

#### 4. Wireless Helper (for Android Auto up to v17.3)
- Our companion app triggers the wireless connection automatically in the background.
- **Compatibility:** Android Auto **v17.3 and below**.
- **Download:** [Wireless Helper on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrerinas.wirelesshelper)
- **Setup:** Set Open Headunit Wireless Mode to **Helper Mode**, ensure both devices are in the same network or Wi-Fi Direct group, and start the service in the Wireless Helper app.

### Connect Wirelessly via Intent (Power Users)
You can trigger a wireless connection attempt using an Android Intent. This is useful for automation tools like **Tasker**, **MacroDroid**, or via **ADB**.

**URI Scheme:** `headunit://connect?ip=<PHONE_IP>`

**Example ADB Command:**
```bash
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "headunit://connect?ip=192.168.1.25"
```

## Known Issues
- **Google Maps in Portrait Mode:** Touch interactions (searching, scrolling) within Google Maps may not work as expected when using Portrait Mode on some devices. **Fix:** Try reducing the **Pixel density (DPI)** setting to **below 200** (e.g., 190) in the app settings. This often restores full functionality.
- **Wireless Connection Drops:** If the connection drops frequently, disable **"WiFi Assistant"** or **"Switch between networks"** in your phone's WiFi settings to prevent it from killing the connection due to "no internet." Check battery saving options.
- **Self-mode on Android 10 (Q) and below:** Google has disabled the automatic wireless projection startup for Android 10 and below in Android Auto versions 16.4 and higher. While Self-mode still works on newer Android versions, it is normally impossible to trigger projection on Android 10 and below directly with recent Google app updates. **Workaround:** You can still use Self-mode on these devices by starting the built-in Android Auto Headunit Server and connecting via Wi-Fi mode (loopback). See the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/andreknieriem/open-headunit/wiki/Troubleshooting#self-mode-on-android-10-q-and-below) for step-by-step instructions.
- **WiFi-Direct needs long to connect:** A user finds that this is related to Google Assistant instead of Gemini for AA. If you use Gemini on newer AA versions it just runs smooth again. No idea why this happens.
- **Stuck on Android is starting** Check your video codec in the settings and set it to h264 if you have a device which does not support h265. Some devices have a broken h265 decoder and this will cause the app to stuck on "Android is starting" and never start the projection.

## Contributing

Creating release apk needs a keystore file. You can create your own keystore file using the following command in root folder:
`keytool -genkey -v -keystore headunit-release-key.jks -alias headunit-revived -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`

After that you need to set the env variables depending on your OS:
MAC:
open ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc

`sudo nano ~/.zshrc or sudo nano ~/.bashrc`
`export HEADUNIT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"
export HEADUNIT_KEY_PASSWORD="YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD"`

## Original Headunit
Headunit for Android Auto (tm)

A new car or a $600+ headunit is NOT required to enjoy the integration and distraction reduced environment of Android Auto.

This headunit app can turn a Android 4.1+ tablet supporting USB Host mode into a basic Android Auto compatible headunit.
