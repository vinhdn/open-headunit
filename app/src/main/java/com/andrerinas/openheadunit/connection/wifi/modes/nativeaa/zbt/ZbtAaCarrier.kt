/**
 * Runs the Android Auto handshake over the head unit's external Bluetooth module.
 *
 * Replaces the accept loop, on units where there is nothing to accept. Our own RFCOMM listener is
 * what normally says a phone has arrived; here the vendor daemon owns the Android Auto server on
 * the module and accepts the phone itself, so this instead opens a channel to the daemon, watches
 * the link state it reports, and starts a handshake when [ZbtAttemptPolicy] says a phone is there.
 *
 * The handshake above it is the same one, unchanged, reached through [HandshakeLink].
 *
 * **One pump, and it changes hands.** [ZbtByteChannel] is driven by whoever consumes it. While this
 * class is watching, that is the loop in [run]; once a handshake starts, it is the handshake's own
 * reader coroutine reading [ZbtByteChannel.input]. They never run at once: [run] stops pumping for
 * exactly as long as [serve] is running. The control-frame callback still fires throughout — on
 * whichever thread happens to be pumping — so it only logs and sets volatile fields, and never
 * writes to the channel.
 *
 * @param serve runs the handshake and closes the link when it ends. `NativeAaHandshakeManager`'s
 *   `handleHandshake`, whose `finally` does the closing.
