/**
 * Runs the Android Auto handshake over FYT's BLINK module through `blink`'s `/dev/auto_serial`.
 *
 * On FYT UIS7862 units with DUDUOS the phone pairs with the external module ("DUDUAUTO") for calls,
 * and the module, not this unit's own radio, owns the Android Auto RFCOMM service. `blink` relays
 * that channel line by line (see [BlinkAutoLine]). This takes the place the stock
 * `com.syu.carlink` holds, so the phone keeps calls on the module and the car's speakers.
 *
 * Sequence as captured from the stock client: the phone's hands-free link comes up (`JH`), `blink`
 * arms the Android Auto service by itself, the phone opens it (`AA`), and the head unit speaks
 * first. Nothing has to be sent to `blink` to arm it.
 *
 * After a handshake the phone keeps pinging over this channel for as long as the session lives, and
 * the stock client answers; [BlinkAutoLine.idleReply] does the same while no handshake owns it.
