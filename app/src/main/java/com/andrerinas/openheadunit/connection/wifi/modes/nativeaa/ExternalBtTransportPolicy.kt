/**
 * Which Bluetooth route the Native AA handshake takes on this unit.
 *
 * [com.andrerinas.openheadunit.utils.ExternalBtPolicy] answers a different question — whether this
 * unit's Bluetooth is an external module — and the two must not be conflated. Detection identifies
 * a *class of hardware*; this decides what to *do* about it, and the sets are not the same. A unit
 * can carry every external-BT marker and still have nothing listening on the vendor daemon's port,
 * because at least one vendor family in that class reaches its module over Binder instead. So
 * detection alone can never be a reason to take the module route.
 *
 * So reachability is an input, and a *measured* one: the daemon is dialled once and its answer is
 * passed in here. A unit whose module answers takes that route without the user finding a setting,
 * and a unit whose module refuses is refused exactly as before. `Settings.externalBtZbtTransport`
 * stays as a manual override for a daemon that is slow or intermittent, rather than as the
 * precondition it used to be.
 *
 * Pure, because the same decision is read at four call sites — `WifiLauncherNative.start`,
 * `NativeAaHandshakeManager.start`, `checkCompatibility` and the settings UI — and they drifted
 * apart once already when the condition was written out longhand at each of them.
