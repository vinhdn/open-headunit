/**
 * The WiFi Projection Protocol over TCP, with this head unit answering the phone's dial.
 *
 * From Android Auto 17.4 the phone can run the handshake over TCP instead of Bluetooth RFCOMM. It
 * learns where to dial from the endpoint we put in our WifiVersionRequest, stores it against our
 * Bluetooth address, and on later connections dials it directly. That is what makes a reconnect
 * work without the phone ever opening our RFCOMM channel again, and it is the only route open to
 * a unit whose Bluetooth adapter the phone cannot reach.
 *
 * We accept the connection but not the TLS server role: the phone dials us and then answers in
 * server mode with client authentication required, exactly as it does on 5288. So this is the same
 * side of TLS we play in AAP, with the same certificate, and [WppTcpTls] is where that is decided.
 *
 * The exchange itself is [WppHandshakeSession]'s, unchanged: a second transport under the same
 * state machine, not a second protocol.
