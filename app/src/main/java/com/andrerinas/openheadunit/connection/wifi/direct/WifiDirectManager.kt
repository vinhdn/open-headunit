     * dead together for a few hundred milliseconds at a time, over and over, with nothing wrong
     * anywhere in the app. It is invisible from a log otherwise, and it is not rare: a dashcam or
     * a phone hotspot the unit reconnects to on its own is enough.
     *
     * Frequencies make the diagnosis exact when both are known: the same channel is shared airtime,
     * different channels means the radio is also retuning between them. Several head units report
     * the group frequency as 0, and on those the comparison cannot be made at all - which is what
     * [StationCoexistencePolicy] is for. It describes and never prescribes: two units have now
     * been measured running clean in exactly the state the old line told them to change.
     *
     * Both arms print. The unjoined one used to return silently, which made the *good* arm of that
     * comparison the only one with a line in it and left a missing line meaning either "not joined"
     * or "the read threw". Whether the unit is joined is the single variable that separated a clean
     * session from one losing picture and sound every ten seconds on the unit that prompted this,
     * so a capture that cannot be sorted into an arm is a capture that cannot be used.
     *
     * Logged once per group and state rather than once per callback, because requestGroupInfo() is
     * issued several places, so this runs three or four times for one group.
