/**
 * Whether the stock `com.syu.carlink`, which reads the same `/dev/auto_serial`, is out of the way,
 * as far as an ordinary app can tell.
 *
 * `pm disable-user` force-stops a package and keeps it from starting again, so a disabled Car Link
 * is not reading the port, unless it is a persistent system app, which a force-stop does not stop.
 * An app cannot see another app's processes, so anything short of "disabled and not persistent"
 * goes to the root bridge, whose guard checks the process itself.
 *
 * On Android 11 and later the package is only visible through the manifest's `<queries>` entry.
