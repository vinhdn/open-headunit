/**
 * Central connection and transport lifecycle manager.
 *
 * CommManager owns the full lifecycle of both the physical connection ([com.andrerinas.openheadunit.connection.projection.ProjectionConnection])
 * and the AAP protocol layer ([AapTransport]). It exposes a single [connectionState] flow as
 * the source of truth; all consumers (AapService, AapProjectionActivity, UI fragments) observe
 * this flow reactively instead of being called imperatively.
 *
 * ## State machine
